- I ran the command "npm install mysql".

- I opened MySQL Workbench, I pasted "ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'myPassword';" on the query box, I selected the text I pasted, I clicked on the Query upper menu and then on Execute (All or Selection), and I ran node demo_db_connection.js.
